# ConsentHub — Development Proposal

**HIPAA/GDPR Consent Management for Microsoft Dynamics 365**

Prepared for: Chris Johnson, TAS Incorporated | February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Development of **ConsentHub**, a HIPAA/GDPR consent management platform natively integrated with Microsoft Dynamics 365. Addresses a clear market gap: OneTrust charges $1,000+/month and isn't healthcare-specific, while mid-market healthcare organizations need an affordable, purpose-built solution.

## Market Positioning

- **OneTrust:** $1,000-5,000+/month, enterprise-focused, not healthcare-specific
- **Gap:** Mid-market healthcare needs $600-2,000/month solution
- **TAS Advantage:** Existing Azure infrastructure, healthcare expertise, Dynamics relationships

|---------|-------------|
| Consent Engine | Capture, store, validate, revoke with digital signatures |
| Dynamics Integration | Real-time bi-directional sync with Dynamics 365 |
| HIPAA Compliance | Pre-built templates, immutable audit trail, authorization workflows |
| Admin Dashboard | Consent overview, compliance metrics, user management |
| Patient Portal | Self-service preferences, consent history, revocation |
